\f0\fs24 \cf0 Hello! I\'92m Shalini Rao, and welcome to my 15-112 Term Project, Dance112. \
\
Dance112 is a variation of Dance Dance Revolution, which is a dance game in which players use arrows that are synchronized to the beat of a song and match them as close as possible to the arrows at the top of the screen. Points are given depending on how close the moving arrow is to the marker at the top when you press the key. My version has the capability to read tempo from a song and apply it to the speed of the arrows and the ability to store and display high scores for each song. \
\
To run the project, open ddrgame.py and run the file. \
\
Make sure to have pyaudio, pygame, and aubio installed using their respective commands in Terminal (pip install [insert name here]).\
\
Hope you enjoy!\
\
